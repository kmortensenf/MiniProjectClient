## How to run the project?

To run this project download the latest release from both Client and Server repositories and either;

Java files:

2. Inside these folders, the .java files are located for both the server/client and the blackjack/chatroom
3. These .java files can then be executed. (Important note: Make sure to run the server files first, else the client cannot connect)

2. Inside these folders, are .jar files and .bat files.
3. Start by running the serverRunner.bat file from 'Executables Server'
